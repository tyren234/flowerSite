                                Back in the middle school, I picked up coding and slowly built up confidence with mostly
                                C++. In senior year of high school and first year of university, I started really
                                focusing on programming in C++ and Python. It was also then that I finally decided to
                                install Ubuntu on my main PC (I use dual boot).

                                Now I study Computer Science (Geoinformatics) at Warsaw University of Technology, give
                                tutoring in high school mathematics and look for a junior developer position.
